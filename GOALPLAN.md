# ACTION CARDS IMPLEMENTATION - iTimeline Community Timelines

**Last Updated**: August 5, 2025
**Status**: üîß IN PROGRESS - Refresh button functionality mostly working, debugging quote fallback logic

## üéØ PROJECT OVERVIEW

### What We're Building
A Bronze/Silver/Gold action card system for community timelines that encourages member engagement through milestone-based rewards and achievements.

### Context & Surroundings
- **Platform**: iTimeline - A modern timeline creation and sharing platform
- **Feature**: Community Timelines (collaborative spaces with membership systems)
- **Scope**: Action cards are timeline-specific, configurable by admins, displayed to members
- **Tech Stack**: React frontend, Flask backend, SQLAlchemy ORM, Material-UI components

### How We're Implementing It
1. **Database Layer**: TimelineAction model storing action card configurations per timeline
2. **Backend API**: CRUD endpoints for action card management with admin permissions
3. **Frontend UI**: AdminPanel for configuration, MemberListTab for display
4. **Real-time Updates**: localStorage-based refresh system for immediate UI updates
5. **Visual Feedback**: Enhanced FAB save button with state transitions

---

## üîÑ CURRENT STATUS (August 5, 2025)

### What's Working
- ‚úÖ **Refresh Buttons**: Successfully added to all three action card tiers (Gold, Silver, Bronze)
- ‚úÖ **Backend Validation**: Fixed to allow clearing action cards (empty title + is_active: false)
- ‚úÖ **Save Persistence**: Cleared action cards now properly save to backend as inactive
- ‚úÖ **Silver Quote Fallback**: Working correctly - shows quote when action card is inactive

### Current Issues
- ‚ùå **Gold Quote Fallback**: Still shows unlock requirements instead of quote when inactive
- ‚ùå **Bronze Quote Fallback**: Broke during recent changes - now shows action card instead of quote
- ‚ùå **Inconsistent Behavior**: Only Silver is working correctly out of the three tiers

### What We're Debugging
1. **Gold Action Card Logic**: Need to investigate why Gold doesn't show quote fallback when inactive
2. **Bronze Action Card Logic**: Need to fix Bronze quote fallback that was working before
3. **Frontend Logic Consistency**: Ensure all three tiers use the same quote fallback pattern

### Next Steps
- Debug Gold action card quote fallback logic in MemberListTab.js
- Debug Bronze action card quote fallback logic in MemberListTab.js
- Test all three tiers to ensure consistent behavior
- Final QA and polish

## üö® REMAINING ISSUES

### Critical Backend Errors
1. **500 Internal Server Error**: 
   - Endpoint: `GET /api/v1/timelines/5/actions`
   - Likely cause: Authentication/JWT token validation issues
   - Impact: Cannot load existing action cards

2. **403 Forbidden Error**:
   - Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/timelines/5/actions`
   - Likely cause: Permission validation logic in `is_admin()` check
   - Impact: Cannot save new action cards

3. **Frontend Reference Error** (FIXED):
   - ~~Error: `setSnackbarMessage is not defined`~~
   - ‚úÖ Fixed: Added missing snackbar state variables and Snackbar component

### Authentication/Permission Issues
- Backend endpoints require JWT authentication but may have token validation problems
- Admin permission checks may be failing for valid admin users
- Need to debug the `is_admin()` method on TimelineMember model

### Data Flow Problems
- Action cards not loading from database due to backend errors
- Save operations failing, preventing persistence
- Member list not refreshing with saved action card data

### Community Creation Flow

1. **Initiating Creation**:
   - Click "Create New Timeline" button on the home page
   - This now creates a Community Timeline by default (replacing the old hashtag timeline creation)

2. **Creation Form Fields**:
   - **Name**: 
     - Displayed as `i-{name}` in Lobster font
     - Validated for uniqueness and appropriate content
   - **Description**:
     - Brief summary of the community's purpose
     - Optional but encouraged
   - **Visibility Toggle**:

   - Original creator cannot leave the community (must transfer ownership first)

4. **Post-Creation**:
   - User is redirected to the new community timeline
   - Welcome post is automatically created
   - Initial settings panel is shown for quick customization

### Community Associations & Post Sharing

1. **Key Differences from Hashtags**:
   - **Creation**: 
     - Hashtag Timelines: Automatically created when a new hashtag is used
     - Community Timelines: Must be manually created by users
   - **Naming**: 
     - Hashtags: `#keyword` (any text allowed)
     - Communities: `i-Name` (prefixed, requires creation)
   - **Discovery**:
     - Hashtags: Always public and discoverable
     - Communities: Can be public or private

2. **Post-Community Associations**:
   - A single post can be shared across multiple communities
   - Users can only add communities they are members of to a post
   - Community chips appear alongside hashtags in the post header
   - No automatic creation of communities (unlike hashtags)

3. **Sharing Controls**:
   - Original poster can add/remove community associations
   - Community moderators can remove their community from inappropriate posts
   - All community associations are tracked with:
     - User who made the association
     - Timestamp of association
     - Source (original post or cross-posted from another community/hashtag)

4. **Moderation Tools**:
   - **Audit Trail**: Moderators can see full sharing history:
     - Who shared the post to their community
     - When it was shared
     - Original source (if cross-posted from another community/hashtag)
   - **Moderation Actions**:
     - Remove post from community
     - Report user for abuse
     - Temporarily restrict sharing privileges

5. **Visual Treatment**:
   - Community chips use the `i-` prefix in Lobster font
   - No additional hover states or indicators beyond the standard chip behavior
   - Clean, minimal presentation matching existing design patterns

### Private Timeline Access Flow
1. **Discovery**:
   - Private timelines appear in search results
   - Basic info shown (name, member count, description)
   - Clear "Private" badge displayed

2. **Access Attempt**:
   - Non-members who visit a private timeline see a restricted access page:
     - Timeline name displayed prominently
     - Artistic "quarantine" styling (caution tape theme)
     - Message: "Sorry, this Page is Quarantined, but you can request access"
     - Blue "REQUEST ACCESS" button

3. **Request Process**:
   - Clicking "REQUEST ACCESS" sends a notification to timeline admins
   - Admins can approve/deny requests
   - User receives notification of decision
   - If approved, user gains member access

4. **Existing Members**:
   - See the full timeline content
   - Have appropriate permissions based on their role
- **Features**:
  - Custom descriptions and rules
  - Member management interface
  - Optional approval workflow for new members
  - Customizable privacy settings (public/private)
  - Future: Custom branding options

# USER JOURNEYS

   - **Hashtag Collections**: Automatic collections of posts with specific hashtags (existing functionality)

2. **Content Interaction**
   - **Public Timelines**: Any user can view and (optionally) contribute
   - **Private Timelines**: Only approved members can view and contribute
   - **Membership Management**: Timeline creators can approve/remove members

3. **Content Creation**
   - Users can create dedicated spaces for specific topics/communities
   - Better organization with clear ownership and moderation
   - More control over who can contribute to specific timelines

# NAMING CONSIDERATIONS

## Current Naming
- **Public/Private**: Clear but potentially limiting
- **Timeline**: The core concept we're working with

## Alternative Naming Options
1. **Public/Private**
   - Pros: Clear, universally understood
   - Cons: Binary, might need more granularity later

2. **Community/Personal**
   - Community Timelines (public)
   - Personal Timelines (private)
   - Pros: More descriptive of use case
   - Cons: Might not cover all use cases

3. **Open/Closed**
   - Open Timelines
   - Closed Timelines
   - Pros: Simple, clear
   - Cons: Slightly technical

4. **Space/Group**
   - Public Spaces
   - Private Groups
   - Pros: More modern, flexible
   - Cons: Differentiates from current terminology

5. **Forum/Workspace**
   - Public Forums
   - Private Workspaces
   - Pros: Implies different levels of interaction
   - Cons: Might be confusing with existing forum terminology

## Recommended Naming
Based on clarity and existing patterns, we recommend:
- **Public Timelines**: Clear, straightforward
- **Private Timelines**: Direct and understandable
- **Hashtag Collections**: For the existing automatic collections

# THE PLAN

## Core Concept
- Users can create public or private timelines (similar to subreddits)
- # (hashtag) timelines will become automatic collections based on hashtag usage in posts
- Timeline visibility can be toggled between public and private, but with restrictions

## Privacy Features
- Public timelines: Visible and accessible to all users
- Private timelines: Discoverable but require approval
  - Appear in search results
  - Non-members see a "Request to Join" button
  - Members see the full timeline content
  - Timeline creator/admins receive and manage join requests
  - Users receive notification when their request is approved/denied
- When switching to private:
  - 10-day cooldown before being able to switch back to public
  - Confirmation dialog with clear warning about the cooldown period
  - Existing followers handling:
    - All current followers are temporarily grandfathered in
    - They receive a notification with a "Click to remain in this timeline" button
    - Can continue viewing content during the 24-hour window
    - After 24 hours, any followers who haven't clicked the button are automatically removed
    - This helps filter out inactive or bot accounts
