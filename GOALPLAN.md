# Main Goal - Community Timeline Implementation

## Concise Plan (2025-08-31)
- **Main goal**: Community timeline implementation
- **Finished recently**: Members page (active/blocked lists, roles, remove/block with real API) and quote system
- **Where we left off**: Admin Page ‚Äî "Remove from community" button behavior and persistence
- **Today's task**: Validate end-to-end removal persistence
  - Call backend removal API (active under `/api/v1/timelines/{id}/members/{userId}`)
  - After success, call `POST /api/v1/user/passport/sync`
  - Clear/update caches so member stays removed after refresh, then re-fetch
- **Next 1‚Äì2 steps**: Add search/filter to members list; verify no mock fallbacks remain

### New Progress (2025-08-25)
- ‚úÖ CommunityLockView integrated across community UI where appropriate
- ‚úÖ AdminPanel access-loading guard added (skeleton shown during access check to prevent UI flash)
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è No backend changes required for the above; frontend-only improvements

### Progress Today (alignment with Postgres passport)
- **Backend** now writes/reads passports from Postgres; endpoints are live: `GET /api/v1/user/passport`, `POST /api/v1/user/passport/sync`. `community_bp` is registered under `/api/v1` so the DELETE member route is active.
- **Frontend** is connected to backend; auth validate calls succeed; ready to drive passport sync after member removal.

### Next Minute Step ‚Äî Remove Button
1) Keep current UI flow in `AdminPanel.js` ‚Üí `removeMember(timelineId, userId)` and, on success, immediately call `syncUserPassport()`.
2) After sync resolves, invalidate relevant caches (`user_passport_*`, `timeline_members_*`) and re-fetch the member list.
3) Confirm that subsequent UI renders and fresh fetches exclude the removed member.

Mini-roadmap after this minute step:
- [ ] Add debug log in `removeMember` success path to record timelineId/userId and sync results
- [ ] Verify `getTimelineMembers(id)` excludes inactive members after refresh
- [ ] E2E: remove ‚Üí sync ‚Üí reload ‚Üí remains removed (across tabs/sessions)

## Current Sub Goal - Admin Page Implementation

### üéØ Admin Page Focus:
Significant progress has been made on the Admin Panel implementation. The member management functionality is now complete with real API integration, replacing all mock data with functional backend endpoints.

### üìå Today's Progress (2025-08-11)
- [x] Active Members on Admin page now retrieves REAL user info from backend (no mock data in this view)
- [x] Unified avatar fallback across app using `UserAvatar` (Navbar, Admin Panel, Members list, event cards/popups, profile pages)
- [x] Fixed initials sizing to scale proportionally with avatar size
- [x] Removed legacy fallback URLs and inline color overrides where found

### ‚úÖ Completed Admin Page Tasks:
- [x] **Manage Members Section** - ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Comprehensive member management functionality implemented
  - [x] Member list display with roles and status
  - [x] Member role management (promote/demote)
  - [x] Member removal functionality
  - [x] Member blocking/unblocking
  - [x] Real API integration with backend endpoints
  - [x] Loading states and error handling
  - [x] Confirmation dialogs for sensitive actions
  - [x] Snackbar notifications for user feedback
  - [x] Tabs for active and blocked members
  - [x] Fixed all syntax errors preventing frontend compilation

### üìã Remaining Admin Page Tasks:
- [ ] **Manage Members Section** - Enhancement features
  - [ ] Bulk member actions
  - [ ] Member search and filtering
- [ ] **Settings Tab Enhancement** - Complete admin settings functionality
- [ ] **Manage Posts Tab** - Implement post moderation features
- [ ] **Admin Dashboard** - Overview and analytics
- [ ] **Search for and remove mock data from AdminPanel fallback/frontend code**
  - Note: Active Members now uses real data; verify no mock fallbacks remain in other Admin tabs/paths
 - [ ] Clean up any unused `Avatar` imports and archive unused legacy components (`old_components/`)
 - [ ] Profile Settings: add user avatar fallback color picker (store preference locally; unify with `UserAvatar`)

### üîç **AdminPanel Status Update:**

- **Active Members view**: now shows REAL data via `getTimelineMembers(id)` with proper avatars and roles
- **Members list (community page)**: continues to show REAL data and now shares the same avatar fallback
- **Remaining concern**: verify other Admin tabs/edge paths have no mock fallbacks

### ‚úÖ/üõ† Member Removal ("Remove from community") ‚Äì TODO Checklist

- [x] Decide behavior with backend: hard delete membership vs soft-disable (preferred?) ‚úÖ Using soft-delete with is_active_member=false
- [x] Wire UI to backend: call `removeMember(timelineId, userId)` in `handleRemoveMember()` ‚úÖ Implemented
- [x] On success: either re-fetch via `getTimelineMembers(id)` or optimistically update and reconcile ‚úÖ Using both approaches
- [x] Show success/error Snackbar with actionable copy ‚úÖ Implemented
- [x] Handle permission errors (only admins/mods can remove) ‚úÖ Backend enforces this
- [x] Keep confirmation dialog; finalize copy and warnings ‚úÖ Implemented
- [x] Add basic test flow: remove a member, verify they disappear and member count updates ‚úÖ Verified manually
- [x] Audit related views (MemberListTab) for consistent behavior after removal ‚úÖ Fixed filtering in MemberListTab.js

### üöß Member Removal Persistence Fix - CURRENT WORK

- [x] Identify issue: Removed members still appear after page refresh
- [x] Analyze backend filtering of inactive members (confirmed working correctly)
- [x] Update MemberListTab.js to properly filter out inactive members (is_active_member === false)
- [x] Fix localStorage persistence to prevent stale membership data
- [x] Clear relevant cache keys after member removal
- [x] Test changes to ensure proper functionality ‚ö†Ô∏è **WORK IN PROGRESS - LAST POINT REACHED**
- [ ] Conduct thorough end-to-end testing of member removal, page refresh, and UI updates
- [ ] Monitor logs for any unexpected reappearance of removed members

### E2E Verification Checklist

- [ ] Delete member via `DELETE /api/v1/timelines/{timelineId}/members/{userId}` (admin/mod).
- [ ] Call `POST /api/v1/user/passport/sync` and verify success + updated `last_updated`.
- [ ] Clear/invalidate `user_passport_*` and `timeline_members_*` caches; re-fetch member list.
- [ ] Reload the page; confirm removed member does not reappear in AdminPanel or MemberList.
- [ ] Repeat in another browser/profile to confirm cross-session persistence.

### ‚úÖ Lock View Work ‚Äî COMPLETE (for now)
- [x] Implement `CommunityLockView` component with clear messaging and CTA
- [x] Gate AdminPanel with access-loading skeleton; render lock view on unauthorized
- [x] Update README with lock view behavior and admin access guard
- [ ] Revisit copy/UX polish after broader testing (defer)

### üéØ **Next Session Action Plan:**

1. Complete thorough end-to-end testing of member removal persistence
   - Test with multiple browsers/sessions
   - Verify proper behavior after page refresh
   - Monitor logs for any unexpected member reappearance
2. Verify and remove any lingering mock fallbacks in AdminPanel outside Active Members
3. Implement search/filtering for members list in AdminPanel
4. Clean up unused `Avatar` imports and optionally archive `old_components/`

### üìã Future Quote System Enhancements (Optional):
- [ ] Add quote history/versioning for timeline admins
- [ ] Test quote system across different timeline types (community vs hashtag)
- [ ] Add automated tests for quote API endpoints and UI flows
- [ ] Document quote system usage for admins and users
- [ ] Performance optimization for quote loading in timeline views

### üìã Completed Quote System Features:
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling for failed quote save/load operations
- ‚úÖ Loading indicators for quote fetch/save operations
- ‚úÖ Quote validation (length limits, content filtering)
- ‚úÖ Quote refresh functionality with default JFK quote
- ‚úÖ Per-timeline quote persistence
- ‚úÖ Visual feedback for quote save/load states
- ‚úÖ Artistic quote display with modern UI elements
( will return to this. currently off-topic migrating to postgres)

## New Focus ‚Äî Blocked-Aware Join Control (2025-09-07)

### Current Status
- The Join/Joined control lives in `src/components/timeline-v3/TimelineV3.js`.
- UI now supports a red "Blocked from this community" banner and hides join/member actions when `isBlocked === true && isMember === false`.
- Data flow for detection (in order):
  1) `checkMembershipStatus(timelineId)` ‚Äî now preserves `is_blocked` through local cache and forces `is_member=false` when blocked.
  2) Fallback A: `getBlockedMembers(timelineId)` ‚Äî may 403 for non-privileged users (expected), used only when `is_member === false` and API omitted `is_blocked`.
  3) Fallback B: `fetchUserPassport()` ‚Äî reads `is_blocked` for this timeline membership if available.
  4) Final safety: one forced refresh of membership to bust stale caches.
- Known gap: the clean membership-status endpoint currently returns no `is_blocked`, so blocked users may still see Join when both fallbacks cannot resolve (403 + stale passport).
- Temporary debug logs added; legacy debug helpers referencing `setSnackbarMessage` caused console errors and will be removed.

### What We‚Äôre Trying to Accomplish
- Deterministic blocked gating for the Join control, without relying on admin-only endpoints or stale passport data.
- Keep all visuals identical to approved designs; only functional gating changes.

### Plan (Frontend)
- Short-term (no backend changes):
  - Keep current fallback chain and remove noisy legacy debug helpers in `TimelineV3.js`.
  - Optional: extract `JoinCommunityControl.jsx` to encapsulate detection and make testing simpler (no UI change).
- Preferred (with minimal backend support):
  - Consume `is_blocked` directly from membership-status response and short-circuit UI to red banner.
  - Keep a small "Sync Passport" button on the banner to reconcile local caches.

### Acceptance Criteria
- As a blocked user on a community timeline:
  - I see a red "Blocked from this community" banner where Join would be.
  - I do not see Join or member-only buttons.
  - After unblocking and refresh, the banner is gone and Join appears (or Joined if reinstated).

### Tasks
- [x] Remove legacy debug helpers that reference `setSnackbarMessage` from `TimelineV3.js`.
- [x] Optionally extract/gate Join controls (no visual change); wire verdict gating in `TimelineV3.js`.
- [x] While backend `is_blocked` signal is limited, use fallbacks (`getBlockedMembers`, passport) safely.

## New Focus ‚Äî Promote/Demote Controls (2025-09-08)

### Goal
Implement Promote/Demote actions in AdminPanel ‚Üí Active Members, cloning the style/behavior/animation you like from `MemberListTab` but without altering approved layout/typography.

### Backend
- Use existing endpoint: `PUT /api/v1/timelines/<timeline_id>/members/<user_id>/role`
- Enforce rank rules already present (actor > target; no self; creator treated as admin; SiteOwner special-case)
- No schema changes.

### Frontend Plan
- Location: `src/components/timeline-v3/community/AdminPanel.js` (Active Members list)
- Add two actions next to user role on the right:
  - Promote: member ‚Üí moderator ‚Üí admin (respect rank rules; cap at admin unless SiteOwner)
  - Demote: admin ‚Üí moderator ‚Üí member (respect restrictions; cannot downgrade SiteOwner)
- Clone the MemberListTab buttons‚Äô style and animation; do not change sizes/margins/typography without approval.
- After role update:
  - Call `syncUserPassport()`
  - Invalidate role-related caches (member lists/count) and refresh view

### Acceptance Criteria
- Promote/Demote buttons appear only when the action is permitted for the current actor vs target.
- Successful role change persists across refresh and sessions (passport sync done).
- No UI layout shifts; animations match MemberListTab style.

### Tasks
- [ ] Add `promoteMemberRole(userId)` and `demoteMemberRole(userId)` helpers in `utils/api.js` (thin wrappers around the role PUT).
- [ ] Render Promote/Demote controls in AdminPanel Active Members with permission gating (UI identical style to MemberListTab buttons).
- [ ] Wire success path: call PUT, then `syncUserPassport()`, then refresh members list and counts; clear relevant caches.
- [ ] Add minimal error snackbar using server message.
- [ ] E2E: promote/demote across roles and refresh; verify persistence and permission enforcement.
