# GOALPLAN — Template

## Main Goal
- [ ] FULL WEBSITE IMPLEMENTATION

## Current Focus
- [ ] Site admin page

## Scope / Success Criteria
- Site Control page (global admin) distinct from Community Admin
- Access: SiteOwner + SiteAdmin role; redirect page for unauthorized users using existing redirect style guidelines
- Two tabs: Global Reports (single queue with type filter) + Site Settings (SiteOwner only)
- Global Reports: posts/users/timelines in one queue; ticket styling differentiates types; update post-type styling to reflect media subtypes
- Site Settings: manage landing page rotating texts + toolbar scrolling LED banner message (text + timing)

## Active sub-TODOs ( smaller tasks that are toward completing current focus )
- [ ] Ideation phase

## Pending TODOs ( larger tasks that are toward completing main goal )
- [ ] Update button on posts (link other posts to a post)
- [ ] Update/improve remark cards look
- [ ] NSFW filter
- [ ] Profile page implementation (existing page needs full build-out)
- [ ] Home page implementation (exists but not functional yet)
- [ ] # hashtag chip voting system

## Completed
- [X] for IMMEDIATE focus next time. i cannot click event markers on timelines. currently the drag mouse icon is overriding all clicking interactions.
- [x] Delete feature and logic (posts/events, creator + admin access)

- [x] Post-creation edit event option

- [x] Timeline motion dissipate: treat motion as zero-event state, pause event rendering during movement, and resume after settle delay.
- [x] Smoother timeline movement achieved via motion dissipate + delayed recompute.

## Notes / Decisions
- delete feature needs to be revisited once admin page is up
- edit feature needs to be revisted once admin page is up
- "delete post" button in community timeline > admin page > manage posts, needs to be revamped and changed to something regarding passing it higher to admin
