## Completed
- [X] for IMMEDIATE focus next time. i cannot click event markers on timelines. currently the drag mouse icon is overriding all clicking interactions.
- [x] Delete feature and logic (posts/events, creator + admin access)

- [x] Timeline motion dissipate: treat motion as zero-event state, pause event rendering during movement, and resume after settle delay.
- [x] Smoother timeline movement achieved via motion dissipate + delayed recompute.

## Notes / Decisions
- Delete feature work paused while resolving errors in smooth timeline movement; revisit after stability fixes.
