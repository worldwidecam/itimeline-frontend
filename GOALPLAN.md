# Main Goal - Community Timeline Implementation

## Concise Plan (2025-08-22)
- **Main goal**: Community timeline implementation
- **Finished recently**: Members page (active/blocked lists, roles, remove/block with real API) and quote system
- **Where we left off**: Admin Page — "Remove from community" button behavior and persistence
- **Today's task**: Make the "Remove from community" button work end-to-end
  - Call backend removal API
  - Clear/update local caches so member stays removed after refresh
  - Re-fetch or reconcile UI state
- **Next 1–2 steps**: Add search/filter to members list; verify no mock fallbacks remain

### New Progress (2025-08-25)
- ✅ CommunityLockView integrated across community UI where appropriate
- ✅ AdminPanel access-loading guard added (skeleton shown during access check to prevent UI flash)
- ℹ️ No backend changes required for the above; frontend-only improvements

### Progress Today (alignment with Postgres passport)
- **Backend** now writes/reads passports from Postgres; endpoints are live: `GET /api/v1/user/passport`, `POST /api/v1/user/passport/sync`.
- **Frontend** is connected to backend; auth validate calls succeed; ready to drive passport sync after member removal.

### Next Minute Step — Remove Button
1) Keep current UI flow in `AdminPanel.js` → `removeMember(timelineId, userId)` and, on success, immediately call `syncUserPassport()`.
2) After sync resolves, invalidate relevant caches (`user_passport_*`, `timeline_members_*`) and re-fetch the member list.

Mini-roadmap after this minute step:
- [ ] Add debug log in `removeMember` success path to record timelineId/userId and sync results
- [ ] Verify `getTimelineMembers(id)` excludes inactive members after refresh
- [ ] E2E: remove → sync → reload → remains removed (across tabs/sessions)

- [x] Add quote_text and quote_author columns to Timeline model and run safe migration
- [x] Monitor for negative side effects post-migration (timeline creation, login, quote save/load)

### 🎯 Foundation Status:
- ✅ **Quote refresh button implemented** - Populates JFK quote in AdminPanel
- ✅ **Database schema updated** - Timeline model now has quote_text and quote_author fields
- ✅ **Backend integration complete** - Quote endpoints can now persist data per timeline
- ✅ **Save notification fixed** - Shows "Settings Saved Successfully!"
- ✅ **No negative side effects** - Timeline creation, login, and core functionality intact

### 🎯 Quote System Status:
- ✅ **Quote visual UI polished** - Implemented artistic quote display with glass morphism, oversized quote marks, and shimmer effects
- ✅ **Quote display aesthetics improved** - Horizontal quote mark positioning, diamond separator, enhanced typography
- ✅ **Visual feedback implemented** - Save states and loading indicators working
- ✅ **Quote system complete** - All core functionality implemented and polished

## Current Sub Goal - Admin Page Implementation

### 🎯 Admin Page Focus:
Significant progress has been made on the Admin Panel implementation. The member management functionality is now complete with real API integration, replacing all mock data with functional backend endpoints.

### 📌 Today's Progress (2025-08-11)
- [x] Active Members on Admin page now retrieves REAL user info from backend (no mock data in this view)
- [x] Unified avatar fallback across app using `UserAvatar` (Navbar, Admin Panel, Members list, event cards/popups, profile pages)
- [x] Fixed initials sizing to scale proportionally with avatar size
- [x] Removed legacy fallback URLs and inline color overrides where found

### ✅ Completed Admin Page Tasks:
- [x] **Manage Members Section** - ✅ COMPLETE - Comprehensive member management functionality implemented
  - [x] Member list display with roles and status
  - [x] Member role management (promote/demote)
  - [x] Member removal functionality
  - [x] Member blocking/unblocking
  - [x] Real API integration with backend endpoints
  - [x] Loading states and error handling
  - [x] Confirmation dialogs for sensitive actions
  - [x] Snackbar notifications for user feedback
  - [x] Tabs for active and blocked members
  - [x] Fixed all syntax errors preventing frontend compilation

### 📋 Remaining Admin Page Tasks:
- [ ] **Manage Members Section** - Enhancement features
  - [ ] Bulk member actions
  - [ ] Member search and filtering
- [ ] **Settings Tab Enhancement** - Complete admin settings functionality
- [ ] **Manage Posts Tab** - Implement post moderation features
- [ ] **Admin Dashboard** - Overview and analytics
- [ ] **Search for and remove mock data from AdminPanel fallback/frontend code**
  - Note: Active Members now uses real data; verify no mock fallbacks remain in other Admin tabs/paths
 - [ ] Clean up any unused `Avatar` imports and archive unused legacy components (`old_components/`)
 - [ ] Profile Settings: add user avatar fallback color picker (store preference locally; unify with `UserAvatar`)

### 🔍 **AdminPanel Status Update:**

- **Active Members view**: now shows REAL data via `getTimelineMembers(id)` with proper avatars and roles
- **Members list (community page)**: continues to show REAL data and now shares the same avatar fallback
- **Remaining concern**: verify other Admin tabs/edge paths have no mock fallbacks

### ✅/🛠 Member Removal ("Remove from community") – TODO Checklist

- [x] Decide behavior with backend: hard delete membership vs soft-disable (preferred?) ✅ Using soft-delete with is_active_member=false
- [x] Wire UI to backend: call `removeMember(timelineId, userId)` in `handleRemoveMember()` ✅ Implemented
- [x] On success: either re-fetch via `getTimelineMembers(id)` or optimistically update and reconcile ✅ Using both approaches
- [x] Show success/error Snackbar with actionable copy ✅ Implemented
- [x] Handle permission errors (only admins/mods can remove) ✅ Backend enforces this
- [x] Keep confirmation dialog; finalize copy and warnings ✅ Implemented
- [x] Add basic test flow: remove a member, verify they disappear and member count updates ✅ Verified manually
- [x] Audit related views (MemberListTab) for consistent behavior after removal ✅ Fixed filtering in MemberListTab.js

### 🚧 Member Removal Persistence Fix - CURRENT WORK

- [x] Identify issue: Removed members still appear after page refresh
- [x] Analyze backend filtering of inactive members (confirmed working correctly)
- [x] Update MemberListTab.js to properly filter out inactive members (is_active_member === false)
- [x] Fix localStorage persistence to prevent stale membership data
- [x] Clear relevant cache keys after member removal
- [x] Test changes to ensure proper functionality ⚠️ **WORK IN PROGRESS - LAST POINT REACHED**
- [ ] Conduct thorough end-to-end testing of member removal, page refresh, and UI updates
- [ ] Monitor logs for any unexpected reappearance of removed members

### ✅ Lock View Work — COMPLETE (for now)
- [x] Implement `CommunityLockView` component with clear messaging and CTA
- [x] Gate AdminPanel with access-loading skeleton; render lock view on unauthorized
- [x] Update README with lock view behavior and admin access guard
- [ ] Revisit copy/UX polish after broader testing (defer)

### 🎯 **Next Session Action Plan:**

1. Complete thorough end-to-end testing of member removal persistence
   - Test with multiple browsers/sessions
   - Verify proper behavior after page refresh
   - Monitor logs for any unexpected member reappearance
2. Verify and remove any lingering mock fallbacks in AdminPanel outside Active Members
3. Implement search/filtering for members list in AdminPanel
4. Clean up unused `Avatar` imports and optionally archive `old_components/`

### 📋 Future Quote System Enhancements (Optional):
- [ ] Add quote history/versioning for timeline admins
- [ ] Test quote system across different timeline types (community vs hashtag)
